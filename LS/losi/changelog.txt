Originally I used the commit log at dev.litestep.com as my changelog, but since
ls.com is down for an unknown period of time I started this changelog instead

2007-01-05: Fixed a misspelling in LanguageStrings.nsh
            Added the-golem's new icons

2007-01-15: Added the-golem's EvarConfig
            Added this file to the installation (in SecCore.nsh)

2007-01-16: Added code to refresh the icon cache so the new icons for the
            different filetypes show up without having to reboot
            Added German language strings. Thanks Sk33p.

2007-01-17: Added a whole bunch of !ifdef statements to make it easier to
            choose what pages to include in the installer. This makes testing
            of a specific page much easier. I also added a new file for the
            same reason, Pages.nsh
            Added a descriptive text to the finish page telling the user why
            he/she needs to reboot/logoff.

2007-01-20: Added a check to stop litestep.exe from starting if the user didn't
            want to set LS as the shell.
            Moved this changelog to the losi directory.
            Fixed the Internet address to LOSI in the .url file.
            The ioHowLS page now displays the username the user would be
            installing to if (s)he choose to install LS for the current user
            only.
            The default IM evar is hardcoded to MSN/Live Messenger. I think
            that is better than blank as it used to be.
            Got rid of the two compiler warnings about unused functions by
            adding !if 1 = 2 !endif around them. This causes them to be
            removed from the file when compiling.
            Made SetShell add the regkey "BrowseNewProcess" when setting LS as
            the shell. I also made it change "Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\
            CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping\system.ini\boot". This stops
            explorer from taking over. So now you can use SetShell.exe to set
            LS as the shell even if it has never been the shell before.
            Added some nice headers/comments to evars.rc

2007-01-24: Added pfx's icons.
            Added the new ThemeSwitcher. pfx noticed a while ago that the
            version of ThemeSwitcher that was included with the installer
            would crash if any of the theme.rc files in the ls theme dir
            had "" as ThemeAuthor, ThemeVersion or ThemeName. I fixed
            when he noticed it, but forgot to add the fixed version to LOSI.
            I've also updated the default themeslist.rc to use
            ThemeSwitcher.exe instead of LSThemeInstaller.exe

2007-01-27: LS wouldn't find the theme when installing to AppData. This is
            now fixed.

2007-02-25: Changed the license text (but not the actual license)

2007-03-03: Began work on a page where you can choose between a "Normal
            Install" and an "Advanced Install"

2007-07-14: Made the evar configuration during install remember your
            choices when going back and forth between the two evar
            configuration pages. Thanks to jc for finding and fixing
            this bug.
            Updated/Added some language strings to LanguageStrings.nsh.
            Thanks to jc for those too.
            Made LOSI print the full/long installation path instead of
            the short, 8.3 version of it. Thanks to jc for telling me
            to do it :)

2007-08-06: Changed LSDir to LitestepDir in the registry (HKLM\Software\
            LOSI\Installer\)

2007-10-08: Finished a new version of the SetShell util. This time it's written
            in LUA.

2007-10-09: Added SLI-ThemeManager to the installer and updated a couple of .rc
            files to support it.
            Updated formating and a few entries in popup.rc
            Changed the shortcuts to change the shell to use the new LOSS
            written in lua

2007-10-10: Added a new option for installing LOSI stuff (for example icons and
            utils). This used to be done when installing the core, but is now
            it's own option. In the process I also made the file association
            a little smarter so it doesn't try to set an icon that doesn't
            exist.

2007-10-14: I fixed some little things today that I noticed when I tried to do
            a full install with losi. I associated .lsz files with
            SLI-ThemeManager.exe. The shortcuts to LOSS on the desktop and in
            the startmenu are now working. I had to supply the full path to the
            *.lua files. Added a messagebox when you switch shells using
            command line parameters (i.e. by using shortcuts). It'll ask you if
            you want to reboot/logoff (Yes or No) or if you want to Undo the
            shell switching. I fixed the code that's supposed to launch explorer
            after uninstalling LS.

2007-10-15: The LOSS shortcuts still didn't work. Now they do. It was a PITA to
            get all the ' and " right :p

2007-10-19: The "Add/Remove Programs" dialog from the control panel froze when
            uninstalling LS. I finally managed to fix this today. The trick was
            to make windows start explorer on its own when I shut down LiteStep.

2007-10-27: Cleaned up Evars.nsh and added some more comments to LOSI.nsi just
            to tidy it up a bit before commiting everything to the repository.
            Made KillLS as nice as un.KillLS already was (using ls.exe !quit).
            Fixed the lsz file association, it wasn't working. Did a small
            adjustment in popup.rc to make the links to LOEC and LOSS work.

2007-10-28: Upgraded from jKey-0.37 to jKey-0.39

2007-10-29: Upgraded to the latest version of xPaintClass. According to Andymon
            (the author) it should really only be in $litestepdir$, but since
            lots of themes get it with NetLoadModule, hence placing it in
            $modulesdir$, he thought it would be best if I put it there as well.
            There would be no conflicts.

2007-11-10: Added the latest SLI-ThemeManager. Localized a few more strings.
            The goal is to get this installer fully localized.

2007-11-26: Implemented logging of installed files. This will give me greater
            control over the uninstall process. It will make sure I'm not
            removing any files I shouldn't be removing. I am using
            http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Advanced_Uninstall_Log_NSIS_Header to
            accomplish this. But I had to make a few modifications to make it
            localized.

2007-11-29: Fixed the uninstalling. It uses the log created during install.
            This means LOSI will not remove files it shouldn't remove. It
            also means LOSI finally cleans up after itself.
            The bug where LOSI would throw a "The memory could not be read"
            error when letting LOSI log off the computer for you is fixed.
            Added $INSTDIR to the confirmation messagebox when uninstalling,
            just to make it that much more unlikely that the user removes
            something he/she wants to keep.
            Made the taskbar AlwaysOnTop in InstDef.
            Fixed a minor bug in the KillLS function where it would run
            KillProcDLL::KillProc "litestep.exe" even if LS wasn't running.

2007-12-28: Updated the German and French language strings. Thanks zbM for
            updating the French part.

2007-12-30: Released LOSI 0.0.9. After that I added an updated engines.list for
            lsx command. Thanks goes out to moshi for writing the updated list.
            The old list is still available as old.engines.list. The first bad
            bug has been found in LOSI 0.0.9. The file association with .lsz
            files didn't work. This has now been fixed.

2008-01-01: If the evar setup can't find MSN Messenger it looks for Live
            Messenger. If it can't find that either it looks for Miranda IM,
            if that can't be found either it gives up and defaults to an
            empty string.

2008-01-04: Added LSAutoHideModules to personal.rc
            Fixed the registry value for SLI-ThemeManager

2008-01-09: Switched one of the NLM sites from loose-screws to nbi-studio.
            Thanks to Andymon for telling me to do it :)
            Released LOSI 0.0.9.2

2008-01-14: Added code to remove the need to reboot the computer. I still have
            to fix the logic that decides whether or not to start LS at the
            end of the installation though.
            Fixed a bug where you couldn't double click a .lsz file to install
            it if the path to that file had spaces in it.
            Removed the extra !recycle at the end of the line that refreshed
            the themes list in the popup.

2008-01-16: Added the possibility to not create any start menu icons

2008-01-23: More work as gone in to the "install ls without rebooting the
            computer" feature. Mostly it's been changes to the finish page
            code.
            I've added zBM's latest French translations.
            The bug regarding registry paths and usernames that Andymon found
            has been fixed. It might affect installations to "Documents and
            Settings" as well, I have to investigate that further.

2008-01-31: Explorer wont start as shell if there is an explorer file manager
            window open when uninstalling LS. So I've added code to kill any
            explorer.exe process when uninstalling.
            Installation to Documents and Settings has been confirmed to work.
            Fixed a bug in the Uninstaller that would make it delete a bunch of
            system settings from the registry when uninstalling if LS wasn't set
            as the shell.
            The "install ls without rebooting" feature is usable now.

2008-05-18: Removed zlib.dll from the installation. zlib1.dll is enough.
            Made the uninstaller remove the losi folder from the registry.
            Made the uninstaller remove the losi folder from the start menu.

2008-05-29: Got rid of an unnecessary variable. It was confusing to have it.

2008-06-02: I tested LOSI today and it seems the "Slow switching between evar
            pages in installer." bug has been solved. I just had to tell NSIS
            to reserve the test.txt file to speed up its extraction.
            The "No themesdir and themeslist.rc/themeselect.rc created" bug has
            also been solved.
            Fixed the file association code. It must have broken somewhere along
            the way.
            Updated to LiteStep 0.24.8 RC1
            Released LOSI-0.2

2008-06-07: Added Web Browser and Image Editor to the top of the popup menu.
            Added Display Settings and Add/Remove Programs to the System menu
            in the popup menu.
            Reduced the number of registry keys changed during installation/
            uninstallation.

2008-06-08: Fixed the bug where the uninstaller would remove too much (it
            didn't keep the personal files even if you asked it to).
            I'm also not closing the uninstaller automatically any longer. This
            makes it possible for the user to read/copy the log messages if
            he/she wants to.
            Made it possible to associate .box files with a text editor.
            (.box files are used by the module LSBox.)
            Fixed this: The checkboxes where you choose what to install aren't
            localized. The text is hardcoded in English.

2008-06-09: Patches from jugg.
            The patches does the following:  Adds release_notes.txt to the
            installation, removes the "read-only" checkbox from the e-var
            browse dialogs and repositions the e-var contents to be evenly
            spaced and aligned on both pages.

2008-06-10: Made a more even distribution of evar configs over the two pages.
            There's now seven on the first page and six on the second.  There
            used to be nine on the first page and four on the second.

2008-06-14: Made the "WhereProfiles" page auto-detect where the profiles are on
            the currently installed LiteStep (if there is a currently installed
            LiteStep).
            Fixed a bug in SectionTheme.  It would overwrite an existing
            themeslist.rc and themeselect.rc.  Now it keeps the users own
            themeslist.rc and themeselect.rc files and only installs the
            InstDef theme.
            Moved the page where you select the Start menu folder.
            Changed the variable name used for determining if there should be
            a warning when canceling the installation or not.
            Added a new page that warns the user if he/she is trying to install
            LiteStep when there already is some version of LiteStep installed
            to the computer.

2008-06-15: Fixed how SLI-ThemeManager was called from the popup menu.

2008-09-01: The check for advanced/normal install should only be carried out if
            the page to select the type of install is included. This is now the
            case.
            I've converted the evar pages to use nsDialogs instead of
            InstallOptions. The reason for this was that I wanted to be able
            to make the "Browse for file" dialog a little smarter about what
            directory it started looking in.

2008-09-03: Updated the language strings. Mostly the French ones.

2008-09-15: Updated to xPaintClass 1.0 update 5.
            Made it possible to compile without support for registering
            extensions while keeping the uninstaller.
            Fixed a bug in PageAndSectionConfigEvars.nsh where it wouldn't
            save changes to evars that were made manually (as apposed to using
            the Browse button).

2008-09-16: Added SLI-ModuleManager and settingsipc-1.0.0.1.dll (needed by
            sli-modulemanager).
            Released LOSI 0.3

2009-01-14: Moved my project over to github.com.
            Fixed a bug where you couldn't change the start menu folder name, 
            and consequentially, when you could change the name, the folder 
            wouldn't get deleted.

2009-01-15: Made all the text fit on the WhereProfiles page.

2009-01-16: When uninstalling LOSI Explorer should start as the shell instead
            of LiteStep. This wasn't always the case however. The code for this
            is much more robust now and hopefully this doesn't happen again.
            The Finish page had code that almost always would set the
            AutoRestartShell registry value to 0. Now it correctly restores
            the value to what the user had before running the installer.
            Added a check to see if there is a litestep.exe file in the dir
            we're installing to. If there isn't there's no need to kill any
            running litestep.exe when extracting files.

2009-01-21: Made the "install for all users" option set the shell in HKLM
            instead of HKCU as it used to.

2009-01-24: I have updated the build requirements listed in LOSI.nsi and gotten
            rid of the dependency on the tSFD plugin since its functionality
            is now included in the nsDialogs plugin.

2009-03-11: Completely switched to LogicLib for SectionCore.nsh.

2009-03-12: Switched to the offical WinVer header in PageWhereProfiles instead 
            of my modified GetWindowsVersion.

2009-03-16: Got rid of compilation warnings when not compiling all sections. 
            (Used for debugging.)
            Added a delay to let LiteStep start before re-enabling 
            AutoRestartShell in the registry. This was needed to prevent a 
            second version of LiteStep from spawning.
            Don't assume the IniFileMapping Shell value has it's default value.
            Always set it.

2009-03-17: Fixed a bunch of bugs/issues I found when enabling NSISArray error
            message boxes in my evar functions.
            Made the wait for LiteStep to start on the finish page actually
            work.
            All users on the computer should now get their own copy of the
            themes folder and personal files.
            Updated to LiteStep 0.24.8 Final.

2009-03-18: Got rid of nbi-studios as a NLM site. Added ls-themes.org instead.
            Updated to xPaintClass-1.0 Update 6.
            Released LOSI 0.4

2009-05-07: Fixed a bug that prevented SLI ThemeManager from working as it
            should.
            Released LOSI 0.4.5
